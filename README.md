HTML for Adams Salvage eBay store.

**Project Notes**
This is a project I am helping my brother with. His job requires him to sell parts from the salvage yard on eBay. On the eBay inventory, he has a custom HTML area with the descriptions of it. I helped him improve the HTML and will include the responsiveness in time. I had to write the HTML and include the Styling in the HTML sheet.
